    Hi, my name is Yvette and I am a Front-End Developer located in the greater Los Angeles area of Southern California. 
    <br><br>
    I have always had a passion for web development, at a young age I taught myself basic HTML and CSS. 
    When I went to high school I continued to take intro classes in web design and graphic design. 
    I strayed away from it for some time, but after graduating from university and spending some time abroad, I knew that web development was my calling. 
    <BR><BR>
        I have experience with programs such as Adobe Dreamweaver, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator. 
    <br><br>
        My goal as a web developer is to create simple and modern responsive designs for the use of others.
